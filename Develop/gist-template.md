# Introduction to Regex

Hello user, this reposiroty was created so anyone who has problems or wish to learn what is Regex can jump on this and feel with a better understanding of what Regex is and how to use iit in our jobs.

for this examples I choose to explain Regex with the example of

```
Matching an HTML Tag â€“ /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/
```

`
Expect the explanations to be done with this example.

## Summary

An explanation of regex, with the example of matching an HTML element as the main focus. The different parts of a Regex expression are explained, including anchors, quantifiers, the OR operator, character classes, flags, grouping and capturing, bracket expressions, greedy and lazy match, boundaries, back-references, and look-ahead and look-behind. To demonstrate how these components function, we offer examples and code snippets.

### What is Regex

Regular expressions (regex) are a set of characters that allow you to search for and match patterns in text. It is a powerful tool for manipulating text and is widely used in programming and data processing applications. To use regex, you need to be familiar with the syntax and special characters that represent different types of characters and patterns in text. With regex, you can perform complex searches and replace operations in text with just a few lines of code. It is an essential tool for anyone working with text data, and mastering it can greatly improve your productivity and efficiency.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

there are two Anchors that we should pay attention to.

- ^(Caret)Anchor
- $(dollar)Anchor

the "^" Anchor is making sure that we have the same on at the beggining of the test here is an example.

```
const regex = /^hello/;
console.log(regex.test("hello world"));   // true
console.log(regex.test("goodbye world")); // false
```

as we can see on the example above the "^" is looking for hello at the beggining of the sentence so it can be true.

and on the other one as it does not start and matches with "hello" the test was false.

now lets see "$" Anchor.

now the dollar anchor is looking for the end of the string to match here is an example

```
const regex = /world$/;
console.log(regex.test("hello world"));   // true
console.log(regex.test("hello there"));   // false
```

for this two exmaples I believe it was better to use normal strings.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers define the minimum and maximum number of times that a character or set of characters must match.

- (+)

```
const regex = /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/;
```

the plus sign means one or more occurrences of the previous character or group, in this casa ([a-z]+) matches one or more lowercase letters. For example, "div","span","p" all of this ones match the part of the regex pattern.

- (\*)

the asterisk means zero or more occurrences of the previous character or group. in this case,

```
([^<]+)
```

matches zero or more characters that are not the following "<"

```
const html2 = "<span class='highlight'>Some text</span>";
```

in the example of the above the class container, would match the html tag providing with a true when we test this.

- (?)

the Question mark means that zero or one occurence of the prevoius character or group. but this one is not used in the example of the HTML tag.

- {}

The curly brackets are also not used for this example of the html Tag matching cases but it can be used ot specify a range of the ocurrence of the previous characters or group between three to five times.

### OR Operator

the or operator in regex is represented by the pipe symbol which is this one "|"and it usuallu allows us to specifyh the multiple alternatives tfor the patters that we have. for this example we are going to use this

```
/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/
```

The OR operator is used inside of a non-capturong group "(?:)" to specify two alternatives to match usully the closing tags of the html

```
(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)
```

- "(?:)" produces a non-capturing group, which doesn't capture the text as a separate group but instead matches it.
- "<" matches the greater-than symbol that comes after the HTML element's beginning tag.

-"(.\'\*)" matches any characters inside the HTML element (apart from line terminators, which will be collected as a group).
-"<\/\1>"matches the tag name in the opening tag, where 1 is a backreference to the first capturing group, which matches the closing tag of the HTML element.
-"|" is the OR operator.
-"\s+\/>" it usaually matches a self-closing tag that ends with a forward slash.

This indicates that the regex will match either a self-closing tag that ends with a forward slash or the whole opening and closing tags of an HTML element (with any text in between).

Here are a few instances of how this regex's OR operator is used in JavaScript:

```
const regex = /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/;

console.log(regex.test('<div>Hello world</div>'));  // true
console.log(regex.test('<img src="image.jpg" />')); // true
console.log(regex.test('<span>'));                  // false
console.log(regex.test('</div>'));                  // false
```

### Character Classes

A character class is a mechanism to match a group of characters in a regular expression. Any character that comes inside the square brackets, [], which define a character class, is regarded as a potential match. For instance, any instance of "a", "b", or "c" will match the character class [abc]. mechanics

lets go with examples:

- [a-z]

the pattern [a-z] matches any lowercase letter this will be included from a to z, in regex the first capturing group matches one or more lowercase letters immedeatly the following starting from the opening of "<"

### Flags

most of the time flags are used after the closing statement all the way at the end.

- g The global flag that enables the regular expression to find more than one instance of an input string.

- i the regular expression matches case-insensitively thanks to the case-insensitive parameter.

- m The multiline flag causes the ^ and $ anchors to match the start and end of each line rather than the start and end of the whole input string.

- s The character is made to match any character, including line terminators, thanks to the dot-all flag.

- u Unicode support is enabled with the unicode flag, which also changes how some metacharacters function.

- y Sticky flag, which makes the regular expression match only at the current position in the input string.

```
const regex = /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/gi;

console.log(regex.test("<p>Some text here</p>")); // true
console.log(regex.test("<div><p>Some text here</p></div>")); // true
console.log(regex.test("<P>Some text here</P>")); // true (because of the 'i' flag)
console.log(regex.test("<p>Some\ntext\nhere</p>")); // true (because of the 'm' flag)
console.log(regex.test("<p>Some text here</p>\n<p>More text here</p>")); // true (because of the 'm' flag)
console.log(regex.test("<p>Some text here</p>")); // true (because of the 's' flag)
console.log(regex.test("<ðŸ˜€>Some text here</ðŸ˜€>")); // true (because of the 'u' flag)
console.log(regex.test("<p>Some text here</p>")); // true (because the 'g' flag allows multiple matches)
```

The regular expression in the preceding example is made case-insensitive and global using the gi flags. Additionally, we use the s option to make the. character match any character (including line terminators) and the m flag to make the and $ anchors match the beginning and end of each line. Additionally, we employ the u flag to activate complete Unicode support, enabling the regular expression to recognize emoji characters. Finally, we match multiple instances of the regular expression in the input string by using the g flag.

### Grouping and Capturing

Grouping and capturing is the process of creating a subexpression within the pattern that can be referred to as a group. These groups allow you to match and capture a specific part of the matched text, which can be useful in various scenarions which will be the following.

- ([a-z]+)

Between angle brackets, this group matches and catches one or more lowercase letters. The tag name is recorded by this group.

- ([^<]+)\*

There are 0 or more characters in this group that match and are captured. This group tracks the characteristics of the tag.

- (.\*)(<\/\1>)?

The closing tag (if present) and the content of the tag are matched and captured by this group. Any character that matches and is captured by the (.\*) at least a dozen times.

```
const regex = /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/;
const htmlTag = '<a href="https://www.example.com">Example</a>';

const match = htmlTag.match(regex);
const tagName = match[1]; // 'a'
const attributes = match[2]; // ' href="https://www.example.com"'
```

### Bracket Expressions

Character sets, commonly referred to as bracket expressions, are used to match a certain character from a group of characters. A group of characters must be enclosed in square brackets [in the syntax for bracket expressions].

For instance, we can use the bracket expression [abc] to match a single lowercase a, b, or c. Similarly, we can use the bracket expression [0-9] to match a single digit. The character can be used to negate a character set; for instance, [abc] will match any character that is not an a, b, or c.

To match particular characters in the HTML tag example, we can utilize bracket expressions. For instance, we may use the formula [a-z-] to match any lowercase letter or hyphen within the tag name. We can use the expression [s] to match any whitespace character within the tag attributes.

To match particular characters in the HTML tag example, we can utilize bracket expressions. For instance, we may use the formula [a-z-] to match any lowercase letter or hyphen within the tag name. We can use the expression [s] to match any whitespace character within the tag attributes.

Here is an updated illustration of how to capture the tag name and characteristics using bracket expressions:

```
const regex = /^<([a-z-]+)([^<]*)?(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/;
const htmlTag = '<a href="https://www.example.com">Example</a>';

const match = htmlTag.match(regex);
const tagName = match[1]; // 'a'
const attributes = match[2]; // ' href="https://www.example.com"'
```

### Greedy and Lazy Match

In regular expressions, "greedy" and "lazy" refer to the way the engine matches patterns that have multiple possible matches.

A greedy match will match the longest possible string that satisfies the pattern, while a lazy match will match the shortest possible string that satisfies the pattern.

for exmaple lets try to use this

```
/<(.+)>/
```

the regex is "greedy" because the ".+" pattern will match as many characters as possible, including and nested angle brackets. So, when we try to match the string.

```
'<a href="http://www.example.com">Example</a>'.match(/<(.+)>/)
// Output: ["<a href="http://www.example.com">Example</a>", "a href="http://www.example.com">Example</a>"]
```

the regex will try to match the whole string.

In this case, the regex engine matched from the first < character to the last > character, including the nested angle brackets in the href attribute.

to make it lazy this is what we can do

```
/<(.+?)>/
```

with the ".+?" the pattern will look for as few characters as possible due that we are on lazy mode.

```
'<a href="http://www.example.com">Example</a>'.match(/<(.+?)>/)
// Output: ["<a href="http://www.example.com">", "a href="http://www.example.com""]
```

in the case above, the regex engine matched only from the first "<" character that was listed on ">" excludintg the nested angle brackets.

### Boundaries

Regex uses boundary matches to indicate where the pattern should match in reference to a word, line, or string. The word boundary "b," the start of the string "" and the end of the string "$" are the three most frequent boundary matches.

Boundaries can be used to verify that an HTML tag is a complete tag and isn't a portion of a longer string when an HTML tag is being matched.

```
// Using word boundary to match the entire HTML tag
const regexWithBoundary = /\b^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)\b$/;
const htmlTagWithExtraText = 'This is some extra text before the <a href="https://www.example.com">Example</a> tag.';

const matchWithBoundary = htmlTagWithExtraText.match(regexWithBoundary);
console.log(matchWithBoundary); // null - tag is not matched because of extra text

const matchWithBoundary2 = htmlTag.match(regexWithBoundary);
console.log(matchWithBoundary2[0]); // '<a href="https://www.example.com">Example</a>' - entire tag is matched
```

In order to make sure that the complete HTML element, and not just a portion of it, gets matched, the word boundary b was inserted in this example. To make sure that the HTML tag is matched at the beginning of the string and does not have any other content before or after it, we also utilized the beginning of the string $ and the end of the string.

### Back-references

Within the same regular expression structure, back-references in regular expressions let you refer to previously matched groups. They are identified by a backslash and the group number, starting at 1. The JavaScript match() and replace() functions both support the use of back references.

```
const regex = /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/;
const htmlTag = '<a href="https://www.example.com">Example</a>';

const match = htmlTag.match(regex);
const tagName = match[1]; // 'a'
const attributes = match[2]; // ' href="https://www.example.com"'
const content = match[3]; // 'Example'

const updatedHtmlTag = htmlTag.replace(regex, '<$1$2>$3</$1>');
console.log(updatedHtmlTag); // '<a href="https://www.example.com">Example</a>'
```

The closing tag (.\*/1>) in this example uses the back-reference 1 to match the name of the opening tag. This guarantees that the tag names of the opening and closing tags match.

The back-reference is once more used in the replace() method to replace the opening and closing tags with the $1 and $3 group values that were collected. This preserves the content while effectively removing any superfluous characteristics or spaces between the tags.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Advanced regex features called "look-ahead" and "look-behind" let you match text depending on the presence or absence of specific patterns before or after the text you're seeking to match. Here is a description of how they operate along with examples that match an HTML tag using the regex pattern:

- Look-ahead

You can only match a pattern with a positive look-ahead if it is followed by another distinct pattern. The syntax (?=pattern), where pattern is the pattern that must come after the matched text, is used to produce a positive look-ahead.

For illustration, suppose we only wish to match HTML tags that have a class attribute. A forward-looking perspective can help us achieve this:

```
const regex = /<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?=\sclass)/g;
const html = '<div class="example">This is an example</div><p>This is not</p>';
const matches = html.match(regex);
console.log(matches); // ['<div class="example"']
```

- Look-behind:

Similar to a positive look-ahead, a positive look-behind scans behind the matched text rather than in front of it. The syntax (?=pattern), where pattern is the pattern that must come before the matched text, is used to establish a positive look-behind.

For illustration, suppose we only want to match HTML tags that come right after the p> paragraph element. To do this, we can employ a constructive look-behind strategy:

```
const regex = /(?<=<p>)<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)/g;
const html = '<p><div>This is an example</div></p><p><span>This is not</span></p>';
const matches = html.match(regex);
console.log(matches); // ['<div>This is an example</div>']
```
